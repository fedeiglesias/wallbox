# Knowledge Frontend Test
Welcome to the Wallbox Knowledge Test for Front-end developers!

## Getting started
This test is here to let you show us your amazing front-end engineering skills.
The task? Build interactions and layout of common web-apps using modern front-end technologies. In Wallbox we are working with a progressive javascript framework called Vue.js
The task will be to implement a user access process and a list of books that can be edited or deleted.

## Development
To build the user interface you should use Vue.js framework:

[vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
 							
Configure your default setup and add all the dependencies that you need.


## Design
The design is important and it's something that we take very seriously at Wallbox.
You have some low-fidelity wireframes in which you can see the layout of the application. You can use a modern UI widget or component toolkits. Feel free to define the look and feel as you see best. We want to see creativity!
Our recommendations are:
* [bulma.io](https://bulma.io)
* [Element](https://element.eleme.io)
* [Materialize](â€‹https://materializecss.com)
* [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en)
* [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre)

## API
You will use a fake Rest api with sample data for testing your application.
